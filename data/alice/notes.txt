The book was downloaded from www.gutenberg.org and renamed to content.txt.

> wget https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt

I was then cut in 10 parts.

> split -l 333 content.txt parts/content-

A .txt extension was added to each part.

> cd parts
> for f in content*; do mv $f ${f}.txt; done

Documents were created by contacting parts together.
